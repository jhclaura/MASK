Thesis internal presentation was done. YAHHHHH. A lot of things to add and also a lot of things to change. <!--more-->

AUDIO check beforehand next time!!! And here are the short lists of feedback, based on my faint memories because I was super nervous during Q&A.
<br>
<br>

####From Critic
<b>They don't buy MASK as a tool to overcome difficulties</b>
Just as mid-term presentation, my original intention seems not echo with others. Am I just enjoying myself?

<b>More user feedback</b>
What did user feel after wearing the MASK? Could do more user tests.

<b>Opensource?</b>
They feel the masks are too special and my style and only I'll make the masks.
<br>
<br>


####From Myself
<b>Something to talk/do more next time</b>
<li>Interact with people in both world.</li>
<li>Once I choose to wear mask, I decide to stay and deal with it, and try to change my mindset.</li>
<li>Change all the still screen capture with video</li>
