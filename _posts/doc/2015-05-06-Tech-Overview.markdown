####What I Used
[Google Cardboard][gg] - put inside MASK<br>
[Three.js][threejs] - platform to build the virtual world<br>
<b>Maya</b> - modeling, rigging, animation<br>
[Pepakura][pepa] - mask paper template generator<br>
[Peer.js][peer] - WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls<br>
[Arduino][arduino] - physical computing<br>
<b>Eagle</b> - muscle sensor circuit design<br>

<!--more-->
AUDIO check beforehand next time!!! 

Here are the short lists of feedback, based on my faint memories because I was super nervous during Q&A.
<br>
<br>

####From Critic
<b>They don't buy MASK as a tool to overcome difficulties</b>
Just as mid-term presentation, my original intention seems not echo with others. Am I just enjoying myself?

<b>More user feedback</b>
What did user feel after wearing the MASK? Could do more user tests.

<b>Opensource?</b>
They feel the masks are too special and my style and only I'll make the masks.
<br>
<br>


####From Myself
<b>Something to talk/do more next time</b>
<li>Interact with people in both world.</li>
<li>Once I choose to wear mask, I decide to stay and deal with it, and try to change my mindset.</li>
<li>Change all the still screen capture with video</li>
