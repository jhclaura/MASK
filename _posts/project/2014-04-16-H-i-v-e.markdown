###H i v e
Live inside a beehive as a community, wherever you are.

###I d e a
Itâ€™s a community nest that connect people to overcome the distance. During the day, people work as worker bees. During the night, people come back to the bee hive and share what they've been through during the day.

By moving heads, users can look around and talk with each other inside the virtual beehive.

###F e a t u r e
- Made of cardboard, paper, wax paper, and LEDs.
- For isolation frustration
