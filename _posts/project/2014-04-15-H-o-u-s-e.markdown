###H o u s e
Connect to your home, whenever you are.

###I d e a
Both physically and virtually being inside the House, you look the real world through different virtual windows. Because of the virtual wall, a distance is created so you feel less timid of the outside world.

There's a window always connected to your home, joining easily by opening the webpage. Whenever you are, you can feel the invisible connection with your house. Also, by expanding the house, user can have quality conversation in the open field, with only two windows (one locale, one remote) remain.
 
###F e a t u r e
- Made of used wine boxes.
- For distance frustration.
