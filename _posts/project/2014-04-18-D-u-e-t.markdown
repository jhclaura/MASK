###D u e t
Nonverbal communications with smiles.

###I d e a
It’s a mask for two persons who hesitate to talk to each other. It’s for the eagerness of communicating without seeing each other’s face yet still feeling the intimacy.

The mask justified the user's behavior. Starting conversation by swallowing people, the user brings both two people into virtual world, where they will be surrounded by four monsters, which are observing whether the users are smiling or not.

Users control the lights both in real world and virtual world, by customized muscle sensors. The lights change with smile levels. Once both of the users are smiling genuinely, the monsters will hold hands, start singing, and swing from right to left. Yet once there's one user stops smiling, the monster will swallow that one and another user has to rescue him or her by smile.

###F e a t u r e
- Made of mylar paper, fabric, Arduino, LEDs, and muscle sensors.
- For nonverbal communications.
