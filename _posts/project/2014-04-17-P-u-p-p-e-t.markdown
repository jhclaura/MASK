###P u p p e t
Having small talks without speak.

###I d e a
Sometime you are either not in the mood, or just feel miserable and don't want to talk to others, but at the same time you don't want to be rude. The puppet will speak for you.

Puppet helps the user to escape the real world, and provides temporary healthy self-pity for the user to enjoy, while puppet beneath you will take care of the real world for the user.

When noticing people approaching, the user can trigger face recognition mode by pressing the foot of Puppet. Once recognizing faces, Puppet will blur the face, and start the small talks for you. 

###F e a t u r e
- Made of foam, conductive fabric, XBee, and a speaker inside the mouth
- For social anxiety
