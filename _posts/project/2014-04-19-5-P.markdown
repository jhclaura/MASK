###5P
An exploration to accelerate touches with visuals and sounds.

###I d e a
<b><i>Still in progress.</i></b> It's a mask for 5 persons. By attaching sensors on the forehead of Cardboards, I can easily detect who is touching who among 5 persons.

Total 10 combinations of touching: AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE. Each of them will trigger specific animation and sound.

AB --> money pops out on the ground<br>
AC --> star appears<br>
AD --> change sky color<br>
AE --> head grows grass<br>
BC --> lightbulb appears<br>
BD --> banana grows out of the ground<br>
BE --> stripe grids<br>
CD --> rainbow shoots out from head<br>
CE --> drop doughnuts and cookies<br>
DE --> generate wave<br>

###Features
- Physical connection
- Senesors on Cardboard, measuring resistance changes when touched
