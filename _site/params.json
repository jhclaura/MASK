Will it change the way we connect to each other?\r\n\r\n![](http://www.jhclaura.com/MASK/mask.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Using mobile phones, Google Cardboard, and customized masks, MASK explores identity through experiences in both the virtual and real world. Users can interact with the people that inhabit both worlds to overcome social anxiety, distance, and isolation.\r\n\r\n### With the \"House\" MASK, a user can see the world through the windows of a virtual house, one of which is a web live stream of their own home. Inside “Hive”, a honeycomb mask, users virtually work, live, and share as a community with other “Hive” users. \"Puppet\", a piggyback mask socializes for users in the real world, while letting users escape into a virtual world.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
