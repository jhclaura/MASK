        <title>Doc: Fabrication Overview</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-used&quot;&gt;What I Used&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;cardboard&lt;/b&gt; - ask for used box in wine shop; buy one paper and ask for cardboard protector/holder (Blick)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;paperstock&lt;/b&gt; - various colors, good for prototype (Blixk)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;wax paper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;mylar&lt;/b&gt; - transparent and durable but less easier to fold (Blixk)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;foam&lt;/b&gt; - from “Economy Foam &amp;amp; futons”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;####Tricks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glue foam with hot glue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fabric glue and staple for fabric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Doc: Tech Overview</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-used&quot;&gt;What I Used&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/&quot;&gt;Google Cardboard&lt;/a&gt; - put inside MASK&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://threejs.org/&quot;&gt;Three.js&lt;/a&gt; - platform to build the virtual world&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Maya&lt;/b&gt; - modeling, rigging, animation&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/&quot;&gt;Pepakura&lt;/a&gt; - mask paper template generator&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://peerjs.com/&quot;&gt;Peer.js&lt;/a&gt; - WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arduino.cc/&quot;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; - physical computing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Eagle&lt;/b&gt; - muscle sensor circuit design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUDIO check beforehand next time!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the short lists of feedback, based on my faint memories because I was super nervous during Q&amp;amp;A.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-critic&quot;&gt;From Critic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They don’t buy MASK as a tool to overcome difficulties&lt;/b&gt;
Just as mid-term presentation, my original intention seems not echo with others. Am I just enjoying myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More user feedback&lt;/b&gt;
What did user feel after wearing the MASK? Could do more user tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opensource?&lt;/b&gt;
They feel the masks are too special and my style and only I’ll make the masks.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-myself&quot;&gt;From Myself&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Something to talk/do more next time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interact with people in both world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I choose to wear mask, I decide to stay and deal with it, and try to change my mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change all the still screen capture with video&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-d-ea&quot;&gt;I d ea&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;
